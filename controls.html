		<p>Being an arcade game, 3rd Strike uses the standard Street Fighter arcade layout: One control stick that goes in 8 directions and 6 buttons, 3 for punch and 3 for kick. Punches and kicks have light, medium, and heavy varieties. Light attacks tend to be fast with little recovery but have small reach and low damage. Heavy attacks tend to have far reach and high damage, but have long recovery and slow startup. Medium attacks are in the middle.</p>
		<p>Attack strength also affects special moves. Specials are done via a motion input, like a quarter circle forward or a half circle back, plus a punch/kick. Just like normal moves, light specials tend to be fast with low damage, heavy ones tend to be slow with lots of damage, and this rule is reversed for specials that fire off projectiles.</p>
