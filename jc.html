		<h3>The Juggle Counter</h3>
		<p>To prevent juggle combos from lasting too long, 3rd strike has an invisible juggle counter. The higher you are on the on the counter, the less time you have to connect your next move. Certain moves will launch a grounded opponent into a free-fall state or will put them into this state on an airborne connect, upon which the juggle counter will be in effect.</p>
		<p>Every move, regardless of whether or not they induce a free-fall state, has a certain, pre-determined value which they will add to the counter. Some moves add 1, other moves add 3, and others completely max out the counter and prevent any move from connecting after. When someone is stunned, however, any move will maintain the free-fall state regardless of whether or not they would do so if the opponent was not stunned, and for this reason moves that otherwise would not see use in juggles have juggle values.</p>
		<p>When the juggle counter reaches a value of 6 or 7, hitting another move after becomes much more difficult than normal, so many juggles end there.</p>
		<p>Certain super arts, like Yun's Genei Jin or Ryu's Shinku Hadouken, can also reset the juggle counter, which would allow for juggles longer than normal to occur.</p>	<p></p>
