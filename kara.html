		<h3>Kara-Cancels</h3>
		<p>One interesting mechanic of 3rd Strike is that any normal move can be cancelled on its first frame into any special, super, taunt, uoh, or throw. Another interesting fact is that certain normals happen to move forward or backward on their first frame. With these two facts in mind, we can deduce that it should be possible to extend the range of specials and whatnot via a kara-cancel, and that is indeed possible.</p>
		<p>Many characters get added utility from the extra range given from kara cancelling, the most commonplace application being throws. Some characters also get new combos that are possible from the added reach, like Ken's midscreen double shoryuken combo.</p>

		<p>The gif above is of Q doing a kara throw with his back medium punch, but slowed down. As you can see he moves very far on the first frame of the attack, then it is cancelled into a throw.</p>
