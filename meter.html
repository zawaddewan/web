		<h3>Super Arts and Meter</h3>

		<p>Upon selecting your character, you are given the choice of selecting one of 3 super arts. Each one functions differently and can be used in different ways.</p>
		<p>Each super art also has a different size bar and can hold more than one super, which affects how much total meter that super art can hold.</p>
		<p>For example, Alex's super art 1, Hyper Bomb, has a large bar and only holds one super</p>

		<p>But Dudley's super art 1, Rocket Uppercut, has a smaller bar and can hold two supers</p>

		<p>Aside from just supers, meter can be used to strengthen any special moves a character has, turning them into EX special moves, aside from a few exceptions, by pressing 2 punch buttons or 2 kick buttons depending on the special move. This uses up a portion of the Super Bar, and no ex moves can be performed without an adequate amount of meter already in the bar.</p>
		<p>Similarly, certain characters can strengthen their supers, turning them into EX super arts, by having a completely full bar and using all of their meter.</p>
		<p>At the start of the game, each character starts with 0 meter, and meter can be built by hitting the opponent with any move, or missing(also known as "whiffing") any move that is not a light punch or light kick.</p>
