		<h3>Option Selects</h3>
		<p>The phrase "Option Select" refers to a series of inputs done such that they will counter multiple things that an opponent might do. For example, an option select in 3rd Strike is the SGGK (super great goal keeper)</p>
		<p>To perform an SGGK, you have to tap down or forward then do a kara throw with any normal. Ideally your normal should be one that you can combo out of rather than one that gives you range for your throw. If the opponent does an attack that is the same direction as your parry, it will get parried and your attack that you used to kara will come out without the throw, allowing you to combo. If they throw, you will escape their throw, and if they do nothing or block you will throw them.</p>
		<p>An example of an SGGK is the Jiro Demon, named after the japanese Akuma player Jiro. It covers the above options, but instead of having the move come out without the throw, a Raging Demon is performed instead.</p>

		<p>The reason why a Raging Demon comes out instead of the move used to kara the throw, Akuma's forward medium punch, is because of a special property of the Demon that allows Akuma to cancel any frame of any normal into it, making the Jiro Demon possible.<p>
