		<p>The Street Fighter III series is well known for its Parry mechanic, which allows a player to negate an attack by tapping down or forward at the right time. For low attacks, you must parry down, and for high attacks, you must parry high. Some attacks can additionally be parried in either direction, and some attacks cannot be parried, like throws.</p>
		<p>If you tap the direction you want to parry in, you have a 10 frame, or 1/6th of a second, window for a successful parry, but if you hold the direction, you only get a 6 frame window, or only 1/10th of a second.</p>
		<p>Also, if you attempt a parry and miss, you are vulnerable to attack and you have a 21 frame, or 7/20ths of a second, cooldown until you can attempt another parry.</p>
		<p>There also exists the Guard Parry, also known as the red parry. This technique allows you to parry while blocking a multihit move where you would otherwise be stuck in block for the entirety of the move's duration. When attempting to red parry a normal move, you have a 3f window, or 1/20th of a second. When attempting to red parry a special move, you only have a 2f window, or 1/30th of a second.</p>
