		<h3>Charge Partitioning</h3>
		<p>Certain special moves in the game are "Charge Moves," which means their input, typically back or down, requires holding a direction for around 40 frames and then pressing the opposite direction, typically forward or up, and a punch/kick.</p>
		<p>In 3rd Strike, charge moves are dictated by two invisible timers. One dictates how much time is left for an move to be charged before it can be performed, and only counts down once the proper input, either down or back, is performed. We'll call this the charge timer. There is another timer, that is constantly counting down and resetting itself from the beginning of a round until it ends. We'll call this one the Partition timer, and it is stopped once a charge move is being charged, and is reset when a charge move is performed fully. The Partition timer denotes how much time you have to continue a charge should you stop an incomplete one. For example, if I start a charge and the Partition timer is at 20 frames, then if I stop charging the move, I have 20 frames to start charging the move again before my charge is lost and I must start it from scratch again.</p>
		<p>With charge partitioning, many things that would otherwise be impossible, such as doing a charge move after a dash or doing a down up charge move after multiple standing moves.</p>

		<p>For example, shown above is Remy comboing 2 standing light punches into his Rising Rage Flash, a down up charge move. Normally, you would not be able to do this, however here Remy first crouches to charge part of his move, then charges again after each standing light punch so that by the second one his charge is complete and he can perform the special.</p>
