		<h3>Piano</h3>
		<p>Because 3rd Strike is not very lenient when it comes to execution,  there are some tricks out there to help alleviate this. One such trick is the Piano input, during which you drum your fingers across the 3 punch or kick buttons, depending on what you are doing. Typically this technique is used in combos where you have to manually time a super art but you have a very small window to do so, and doing the Piano input gives you 6 chances to hit the window during which you must super. The reason why you get 6 chances as opposed to 3, one for each button, is because of a Street Fighter mechanic known as Negative Edge. Negative Edge refers to the fact that when performing specials or supers, the release of a button counts as a button press, and so each press and each release of the button counts as a potential chance for a super to come out.</p>
		<p>A similar technique is the double tap, where you use two fingers to drum one button. This mainly done to help time normals or have more consistency with supers or specials where the strength of the attack matters.</p>
