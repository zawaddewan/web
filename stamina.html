		<h3>Stamina and Stun</h3>
		<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ws481vw.png">
		<p>Each character has stamina, or health, denoted by the big green bar. Underneath the green bar is a smaller, black bar. It fills up with red and is the stun bar. Stun increases as you take damage, which different attacks doing different amounts of stun. Some characters can take more stun or have more stamina than others.</p>
		<p>When a character gets stunned on the ground, they enter a dizzy state, where they remain vulnerable until they "shake out of it." They can escape the dizzy state faster by mashing on the stick and buttons. If they get stunned in the air, they enter a free-fall state where they may be juggled by other moves, then when they fall they get up and enter the dizzy state.</p>
