	<h2>What is 3rd Strike?</h2>
		<p>
			Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike is a 2D fighting game developed by Capcom, released for the CPS-3 Arcade system in 1999, and later was ported to the PlayStation 2, Dreamcast, Xbox, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3(as 3rd Strike: Online Edition), and later on the Nintendo Switch, Steam, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 as a part of the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection.
			3rd Strike is part of a trilogy, as it is the Sequel to Street Fighter III: Second Impact, which is itself a sequel to Street Fighter III: New Generation.
			Widely considered to be one of the greatest fighting games of all time, 3rd Strike is praised for its polished system mechanics, amazing art style and animation, and incredible depth.
			Even though its more than 20 years old now, the game has a healthy scene with many people who have stuck around since its arcade days and many others who are just now joining the community as newcomers.

	<h2>System Mechanics</h2>
	<h3>Parry</h3>

		<p>The Street Fighter III series is well known for its Parry mechanic, which allows a player to negate an attack by tapping down or forward at the right time. For low attacks, you must parry down, and for high attacks, you must parry high. Some attacks can additionally be parried in either direction, and some attacks cannot be parried, like throws.</p>
		<p>If you tap the direction you want to parry in, you have a 10 frame, or 1/6th of a second, window for a successful parry, but if you hold the direction, you only get a 6 frame window, or only 1/10th of a second.</p>
		<p>Also, if you attempt a parry and miss, you are vulnerable to attack and you have a 21 frame, or 7/20ths of a second, cooldown until you can attempt another parry.</p>
		<p>There also exists the Guard Parry, also known as the red parry. This technique allows you to parry while blocking a multihit move where you would otherwise be stuck in block for the entirety of the move's duration. When attempting to red parry a normal move, you have a 3f window, or 1/20th of a second. When attempting to red parry a special move, you only have a 2f window, or 1/30th of a second.</p>
	<h3>Taunts</h3>
		<p>Taunts are not just for show in 3rd Strike. Every taunt in the game gives its user a stat boost or helps them out in some way.</p>

		<h3>Super Arts and Meter</h3>

			height=180
			width=320>
		<p>Upon selecting your character, you are given the choice of selecting one of 3 super arts. Each one functions differently and can be used in different ways.</p>
		<p>Each super art also has a different size bar and can hold more than one super, which affects how much total meter that super art can hold.</p>
		<p>For example, Alex's super art 1, Hyper Bomb, has a large bar and only holds one super</p>

		<p>But Dudley's super art 1, Rocket Uppercut, has a smaller bar and can hold two supers</p>
		<img src="https://i.imgur.com/STxh74z.png"
			height="288"
			width="294">
		<p>Aside from just supers, meter can be used to strengthen any special moves a character has, turning them into EX special moves, aside from a few exceptions, by pressing 2 punch buttons or 2 kick buttons depending on the special move. This uses up a portion of the Super Bar, and no ex moves can be performed without an adequate amount of meter already in the bar.</p>
		<p>Similarly, certain characters can strengthen their supers, turning them into EX super arts, by having a completely full bar and using all of their meter.</p>
		<p>At the start of the game, each character starts with 0 meter, and meter can be built by hitting the opponent with any move, or missing(also known as "whiffing") any move that is not a light punch or light kick.</p>
	<h3>Stamina and Stun</h3>
		<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ws481vw.png">
		<p>Each character has stamina, or health, denoted by the big green bar. Underneath the green bar is a smaller, black bar. It fills up with red and is the stun bar. Stun increases as you take damage, which different attacks doing different amounts of stun. Some characters can take more stun or have more stamina than others.</p>
		<p>When a character gets stunned on the ground, they enter a dizzy state, where they remain vulnerable until they "shake out of it." They can escape the dizzy state faster by mashing on the stick and buttons. If they get stunned in the air, they enter a free-fall state where they may be juggled by other moves, then when they fall they get up and enter the dizzy state.</p>
	<h3>Blocking/Guarding</h3>
		<p>Like in every Street Fighter, you can hold back to block high attacks and hold down-back to block low attacks. If you block a special move or a super art, you will take a small percentage of that move's damage on block as "chip damage." You can be knocked out by chip damage, although parries negate this.</p>
	<h3>Knockdowns and Quick Standing</h3>
		<p>Many moves can knock you or your opponent down, causing a knockdown. If you press down as you touch the ground, you can perform a quick stand, during which your character will roll backwards and get up faster than they otherwise would have. Supers and certain other moves cause hard knockdowns, which you cannot quick stand.</p>
	<h3>Throws and Grabs</h3>
		<p>By pressing light punch and light kick at the same time, you can throw an opponent. Throws cannot be blocked or parried, but they can be escaped when two people press throw around the same time or with a jump.</p>
		<p>There are also Command Grabs. These are special throws that are tied to motion inputs. They cannot be blocked nor can they be escaped or parried, but you can jump to escape them. They also cannot typically be comboed into, aside from a few certain circumstances, but some can start combos.</p>
		<p>In a similar vein, there are Hit Grabs. These are command grabs that CAN be blocked, but they can be comboed into and cannot be parried. They also induce a hard knockdown.</p>
	<h3>Leap Attack</h3>
		<p>The Leap Attack, or Universal Overhead(UOH), can be performed by pressing medium punch and medium kick at the same time, which causes your character to do a small hop and do an aerial attack. UOHs are very versitile as they cannot be blocked low, can hop over low attacks, and can start combos if they hit very late into their animation. Its best to do a UOH from afar or as an opponent is getting up so that it hits as late as possible and you can move sooner.</p>

	<h3>The Juggle Counter</h3>
		<p>To prevent juggle combos from lasting too long, 3rd strike has an invisible juggle counter. The higher you are on the on the counter, the less time you have to connect your next move. Certain moves will launch a grounded opponent into a free-fall state or will put them into this state on an airborne connect, upon which the juggle counter will be in effect.</p>
		<p>Every move, regardless of whether or not they induce a free-fall state, has a certain, pre-determined value which they will add to the counter. Some moves add 1, other moves add 3, and others completely max out the counter and prevent any move from connecting after. When someone is stunned, however, any move will maintain the free-fall state regardless of whether or not they would do so if the opponent was not stunned, and for this reason moves that otherwise would not see use in juggles have juggle values.</p>
		<p>When the juggle counter reaches a value of 6 or 7, hitting another move after becomes much, much difficult, so many juggles end there.</p>
		<p>Certain super arts, like Yun's Genei Jin or Ryu's Shinku Hadouken, can also reset the juggle counter, which would allow for juggles longer than normal to occur.</p>	<p></p>
