		<h3>Throws and Grabs</h3>
		<p>By pressing light punch and light kick at the same time, you can throw an opponent. Throws cannot be blocked or parried, but they can be escaped when two people press throw around the same time or with a jump.</p>
		<p>There are also Command Grabs. These are special throws that are tied to motion inputs. They cannot be blocked nor can they be escaped or parried, but you can jump to escape them. They also cannot typically be comboed into, aside from a few certain circumstances, but some can start combos.</p>
		<p>In a similar vein, there are Hit Grabs. These are command grabs that CAN be blocked, but they can be comboed into and cannot be parried. They also induce a hard knockdown.</p>
