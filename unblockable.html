		<h3>Unblockables</h3>
		<p>A rule of 3rd Strike is that any projectile that is launched from one side must be blocked relative to the side it originated from. For example, if one character were to throw a projectile at you while you were standing on the right side, you would have to hold your stick to the right in order to block. However, if they were to somehow to go the other side of you while the projectile is travelling, thus making it so that you were on the left side now, you would still have to hold to the right in order to block the projectile.</p>
		<p>With this in mind, multiple unblockable setups exist using this principle. The basic idea is to setup a projectile, typically a super, then cross over to the other side and press a move while they are attempting to block the projectile. Since no human being can block in two directions simultaneously, the result is an unblockable attack. The most infamous unblockable setups belong to Oro and Urien, who can use their Yagyou Dama and Aegis Reflector supers respectively to do an unblockable, and use it to setup up another one in order to loop them together.</p>

		<p>The video above shows Oro's unblockable loop, performed on Urien. Unblockable loops are part of what makes these characters so deadly, however there is an escape. You can parry the super, then the opponent, in the super again in quick succession in order to escape, however the person doing the unblockable can vary their timings in order to punish your attempt at an escape.</p>
