		<h3>Leap Attack</h3>
		<p>The Leap Attack, or Universal Overhead(UOH), can be performed by pressing medium punch and medium kick at the same time, which causes your character to do a small hop and do an aerial attack. UOHs are very versitile as they cannot be blocked low, can hop over low attacks, and can start combos if they hit very late into their animation. Its best to do a UOH from afar or as an opponent is getting up so that it hits as late as possible and you can move sooner.</p>
