	<h2>What is 3rd Strike?</h2>
			<p>
				Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike is a 2D fighting game developed by Capcom, released for the CPS-3 Arcade system in 1999, and later was ported to the PlayStation 2, Dreamcast, Xbox, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3(as 3rd Strike: Online Edition), and later on the Nintendo Switch, Steam, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 as a part of the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection.
				3rd Strike is part of a trilogy, as it is the Sequel to Street Fighter III: Second Impact, which is itself a sequel to Street Fighter III: New Generation.
				Widely considered to be one of the greatest fighting games of all time, 3rd Strike is praised for its polished system mechanics, amazing art style and animation, and incredible depth.
				Even though its more than 20 years old now, the game has a healthy scene with many people who have stuck around since its arcade days and many others who are just now joining the community as newcomers.
